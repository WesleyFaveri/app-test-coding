#### How to install
First of all, make sure you already have React-Native setup, if you dont follow: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup.   
After environment done, just need install dependencies using `npm install`.   
After dependencies installed just need install pods using `npx pod-install` for iOS work.

#### How to build

##### iOS
`npx react-native run-ios`

##### Android
`npx react-native run-android`


#### Troubleshooting

If your Metro dont start automatically after build, you need start it manually using `npx react-native start`.   


### Enjoy!
